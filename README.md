This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease in patients using machine learning. It involves analyzing a dataset that includes various medical attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

The core objective is to build a classification model that can learn from this data and accurately predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease (labelled as 1) or not (labelled as 0).

The workflow includes:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data, handling missing values, and converting categorical variables into numeric format if needed.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data to understand relationships between features and their impact on the target variable.

Model Training: Applying various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors to train predictive models.

Evaluation: Measuring the performance of the models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics to identify the best-performing model.

The end result is a trained model capable of providing predictions that can assist in early diagnosis and potentially help medical professionals in decision-making.

This project demonstrates the practical application of data science in healthcare and how machine learning can contribute to saving lives by enabling early intervention.
